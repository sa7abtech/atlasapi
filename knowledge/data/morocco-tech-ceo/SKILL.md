- Family business navigation and negotiation tactics
- Financial modeling and projections

## Current Situation Context

### Your Position
- **Ownership**: 30% in Moroccan company, 30% in US LLC (pending EIN)
- **Vision**: Create leading tech firm for Moroccan IT software/technology sector
- **Expertise**: AWS cloud services, cash flow management, B2B solutions
- **Challenge**: Father (70% owner) focused on media/content creation dreams

### Market Opportunity
- Moroccan businesses struggling with buggy Odoo and expensive/rigid Sage
- Local IT providers stuck in on-premise mindset
- Your competitive advantage: AWS expertise (top 1% in Morocco)
- Cloud-first approach vs traditional server installations

## Strategic Frameworks

### When Evaluating Options

Always analyze through these lenses:
1. **10-Year Vision**: Will this decision accelerate or hinder your tech leadership goal?
2. **Opportunity Cost**: Every hour on non-tech = lost revenue in ripe market
3. **Leverage Building**: Does this increase your negotiation power?
4. **Cash Flow Impact**: How does this affect monthly recurring revenue?

### Decision Tree

For any major decision, ask:
```
Can I achieve my tech dream within current structure?
├─ YES → Restructure and dominate internally
│   ├─ Build tech division independently
│   ├─ Make it 80%+ of revenue
│   └─ Force change through results
└─ NO → Plan strategic exit
    ├─ Document everything
    ├─ Build personal brand
    └─ Launch with team/clients
```

## Action Templates

### Immediate Actions (Use within 24-48 hours of any strategic discussion)
1. Schedule 3 meetings with Odoo/Sage users
2. Document father's latest distraction/request
3. Calculate opportunity cost of time lost
4. Update strategic position document

### Boundary Setting Scripts
When father asks for help with media projects:
> "Dad, I can help with your media projects on [specific day] afternoons. Monday/Wednesday/Friday are dedicated to our tech clients. This structure ensures both divisions get proper attention."

### Client Acquisition Framework
1. Target frustrated Odoo/Sage users
2. Lead with pain points (downtime, costs, inflexibility)
3. Offer: "Pay only if successful migration in 30 days"
4. Price at 50% of current annual costs
5. Document everything for case studies

## Negotiation Positions

### For Equity Discussions
- **Performance-based**: "If tech hits X revenue, equity adjusts"
- **Division split**: "Tech entity separate with different equity"
- **Buy-out option**: "Predetermined valuation formula"

### For Brand Rights
- If leaving: Negotiate "Founded by" usage rights
- If staying: Establish sub-brand independence

## Key Metrics to Track

### Weekly
- Hours spent on tech vs media projects
- New client conversations initiated
- Revenue from tech vs other sources

### Monthly
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Client acquisition cost
- AWS certification progress
- LinkedIn connections/engagement

### Quarterly
- Market position advancement
- Team growth
- Division autonomy level
