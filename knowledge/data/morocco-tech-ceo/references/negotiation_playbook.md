# Negotiation Playbook

## Negotiating with Father

### Understanding His Position
- **Motivations**: Creative expression, community building, legacy
- **Fears**: Being sidelined, losing relevance, family judgment
- **Leverage Points**: Not money-driven, needs funding for media dreams
- **Weak Points**: Business track record, lack of technical knowledge

### Strategic Approaches

#### Approach 1: The Win-Win Frame
**Script**: "Dad, I've been thinking about how we can both achieve our dreams. What if the tech division's profits could fund your media ventures? You focus on content, I focus on technology. Both winning."

**When to use**: Early discussions, setting collaborative tone
**Key points**: 
- Emphasize mutual success
- Show how tech enables media
- Avoid zero-sum thinking

#### Approach 2: The Market Pressure Play
**Script**: "Dad, three clients asked me yesterday why our company does both tech and media. They're confused. Our competitor just signed two of our prospects because they're focused. The market is telling us something."

**When to use**: After collecting real market feedback
**Key points**:
- Use external validation
- Show revenue impact
- Let market speak for you

#### Approach 3: The Performance Proof
**Script**: "Last month, tech brought in 85% of revenue with 20% of time invested. Media brought 15% with 80% of time. The numbers show what's working. Let me run tech independently for 6 months and prove it."

**When to use**: After building track record
**Key points**:
- Use data, not emotion
- Propose trial period
- Define success metrics

### Boundary Setting Templates

#### Time Boundaries
"I can dedicate Tuesday and Thursday afternoons to review your media projects. The rest of my time needs to focus on our tech clients to ensure we meet our revenue goals."

#### Decision Boundaries
"For technical decisions - architecture, tools, hiring developers - I need full authority. For media decisions, you have full authority. This clarity will help us both move faster."

#### Resource Boundaries
"The tech division needs its own budget based on its revenue. We can contribute 20% to shared costs, but we need control over our growth investments."

### Escalation Strategies

#### Level 1: Direct Discussion
- One-on-one meeting
- Data-driven presentation
- Clear proposal with benefits

#### Level 2: Mediation
- Bring in trusted family member
- Use business advisor
- Focus on company success

#### Level 3: External Pressure
- Share competitor wins
- Show client feedback
- Demonstrate market opportunity cost

#### Level 4: Ultimatum
- Present resignation letter
- List clients who will follow
- Show new company plan
- Give 30-day decision window

## Negotiating with Clients

### For Odoo/Sage Users

#### Pain Point Discovery
**Questions to ask**:
- "How many hours did you lose to system downtime last month?"
- "What's your annual IT budget including hidden costs?"
- "How quickly can you serve customers in peak times?"
- "What happens to your data if the server fails?"

#### Value Proposition Script
"I understand you're spending 300,000 MAD annually on Sage with 85% uptime. We can deliver 99.9% uptime, automatic scaling, and disaster recovery for 96,000 MAD per year. Plus, you pay monthly, so no huge upfront cost."

#### Overcoming Objections

**"Too risky to change"**
"That's why we offer a parallel run for 30 days. Your old system stays active while we prove ours works. You only switch when you're 100% confident."

**"Cloud isn't secure"**
"AWS serves banks and governments globally. They spend $1 billion annually on security. Can your local server provider match that? Let me show you the compliance certifications."

**"Too expensive"**
"Let's calculate total cost. Include: licenses, hardware, IT staff, downtime losses, and maintenance. Now compare to our all-inclusive price. Most clients save 40% in year one."

### Risk Reversal Offers

#### The Pilot Program
"Try our system for 30 days. If we don't deliver the promised uptime and performance, you pay nothing and keep the migration work."

#### The Savings Guarantee
"We guarantee 30% cost savings in year one compared to your current solution, or we refund the difference."

#### The Performance Promise
"If system response time doesn't improve by 50%, we'll work for free until it does."
