## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1️⃣ Configure Environment

```bash

nano .env
```

Add your keys:
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-anon-key

### 2️⃣ Setup Database

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Open SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire file:
   ```bash
   cat supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql
   ```
4. Click "Run"

### 3️⃣ Load Knowledge Base

```bash
# Automated loading (recommended)
./load_knowledge_base.py

# Or using Make
make load-kb
```

This will:

cd docker && docker-compose up -d
```

## Verify Everything Works

```bash
# 1. Check API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# 2. Check knowledge base loaded
curl http://localhost:8000/knowledge/stats

# 3. Test a query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
