## 9. MINDSET & PSYCHOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK

### Key Realizations
1. **Brand vs. Execution**: Brands are built by execution, not names
   - Facebook was "TheFacebook"

2. **Power Dynamics**: Founder has more leverage than perceived
   - Technical skills (rare in market)
   - Money orientation
   - Energy and youth
   - Client relationship capabilities
   - Time advantage

3. **Opportunity Cost**: Every hour on media projects = lost tech revenue
   - Moroccan market is ready NOW
   - First-mover advantage available
   - Competition could emerge

### Mental Models for Decision-Making
- **"What would a CEO do?"** - Remove emotion, focus on value creation
- **"What's the 10-year view?"** - Short-term pain vs. long-term gain
- **"Where's the leverage?"** - Always negotiate from strength
- **"Follow the money"** - Cash flow determines success

### Dealing with Father
- Don't seek permission, demonstrate results
- Create irreversible momentum
- Use market pressure, not family pressure
- Frame everything as business, not personal
- Show how tech success funds his dreams
